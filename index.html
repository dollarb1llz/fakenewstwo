          <p>
            This is what I like to call way to early for a burger.
            First of all it doesn't even digest in your body.
            So with that being said. Lets just stay away from that food.

            WASHINGTON DC - This is what I like to call a penguin
            marching in the freezing cold temperatures. When his
            genitals begin to freeze is an indication that the
            harmless animal is begining to die. Who in their right mind
            would freeze their own genitals? Holy.. I mean just wow.
            Some would say it feels very similar to a kick to the nads
            during defrostation. But that's just a rumor.

              BROOKLYIN, NY - in the days of american baseball
              a human being was sitting on upper deck watching people
              hit balls with bats. All of a sudden, he strikes an
              interesting set of breasts. He finds that he can't
              take his eyes off of them, yet looking at a womens
              breasts is offensive and so he knows he must sneak
              the looks. But heck, you might as well look because
              who cares if you offend people.
